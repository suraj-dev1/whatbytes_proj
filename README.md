üè• WhatBytes Healthcare Backend API
This project is a Django-based REST API backend built for managing healthcare-related data, created as part of the Backend Developer Internship assignment for WhatBytes.

It includes JWT-based user authentication, doctor-patient mappings, and RESTful endpoints to manage the data with full CRUD operations.

üîß Tech Stack
Backend Framework: Django 4.x

API Layer: Django REST Framework (DRF)

Authentication: JWT ( Web Tokens)

Database: SQLite (for testing, can be switched to PostgreSQL)

Language: Python 3.x

  Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository




git clone https://github.com/suraj-dev1/whatbytes_proj.git
cd whatbytes_proj
Create & Activate Virtual Environment




python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate    # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
Install Dependencies




pip install -r requirements.txt
Apply Migrations




python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
Create Superuser (Optional for Admin Panel)




python manage.py createsuperuser
Run the Development Server




python manage.py runserver
Access the API at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/

 Authentication ‚Äì JWT
Use the following endpoints to obtain and refresh tokens:

POST /api/token/ ‚Äì Get access and refresh token

POST /api/token/refresh/ ‚Äì Refresh the access token

Sample Payload:
